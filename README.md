# signalRGB-Sleep
It would be so awesome if the signalRGB team would add a "Turn off RGB when screen is off/idle".  I'm impatient, so this is my attempt at a kludge to add this functionality via an open source windows utility. This is largely just a dust off my coding activities. I'm sharing in case anyone else would like to have this functionality without too much trouble.
