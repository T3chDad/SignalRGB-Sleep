# signalRGB-Sleep
It would be so awesome if the signalRGB team would add a "Turn off RGB when screen is off/idle" option.  

I'm impatient, so this is my attempt at a kludge to add this functionality via an open source windows utility. This is largely just an excersize to dust off my coding activities. I'm sharing this application in case anyone else would like to have this functionality to signalRGB without too much trouble. No installation is needed. Just download the zip and extract it somewhere on your system that signalRGB is installed on and set the signalRGB-Sleep.exe to start with windows.

Use this program at your own risk. I'm not responsible for anything that happens on your system.
